        <h2>Our Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-time disaster tracking:</strong> Monitor and track natural disasters such as floods, pollution events, and droughts, especially in major rivers like the Ganges and Yamuna.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficient resource management:</strong> Manage development projects, river cleaning initiatives, and disaster mitigation efforts efficiently across India.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure monitoring:</strong> Track the condition of critical infrastructure like dams, barrages, and canals to prevent potential risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive project management:</strong> Get detailed views of all ongoing and past river development projects, such as the National Ganga River Basin Project.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic reporting:</strong> Use historical data to inform future disaster preparedness, drought management, and water conservation efforts across India's river systems.</li>

        <h2>How Technology Powers River Management</h2>
        <p>Our system uses cutting-edge technologies to improve monitoring and decision-making for disaster preparedness across India's rivers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IoT Sensors:</strong> Real-time data on water levels, flow rates, and rainfall from sensor networks along the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and other major rivers.</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Predict floods and droughts based on historical data, offering early warnings for disaster preparedness in flood-prone areas of Bihar, Assam, and Uttar Pradesh.</li>
            <li><strong>Satellite Imagery:</strong> Monitor river water quality and detect changes in riverbanks and deforestation through satellite data, including initiatives like Clean Ganga.</li>
